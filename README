NAME

  Dresden - A module for mostly educational purposes,
            although with useful functionality.

ABOUT

  This project is an educational collecting tank for any functions
  and/or experiments we (the Dresden Perl Mongers) need a place for.

  Version 0.01, for instance, is an empty project, simply demonstrating
  the construction of a CPAN distribution. If you ever need a skeleton,
  Dresden version 0.01 is for you.

  There are future plans, anyway, to make it a useful module, e.g., it
  will provide information about Dresden Perl Mongers, either in a static
  or dynamic network fashion based on info on our homepage.
